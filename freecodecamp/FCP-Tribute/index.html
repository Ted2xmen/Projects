            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Jackie Chan’s real name is Chan Kong-Sang. Early in his career, Jackie experimented with several different movie credit names including Yuen Lau, Chen Yuan-Lung, Chen Lung and Chen Hsin. But it was in between acting jobs where he finally found a name he liked. After Bruce Lee‘s death in 1973, the booming Hong Kong film industry collapsed. Many actors, including Jackie, struggled to find film work and looked elsewhere. In the mid-1970s, Jackie briefly worked for a construction worker named Jack. On the construction site, the pair were nicknamed “Big Jack” and “Little Jack”. Jackie shortened the name Little Jack Chan to “Jackie Chan” and the name stuck with him the rest of his career.</p>
